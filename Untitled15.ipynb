        "Ensemble techniques is a method where we use many small models instead of just one. Each of these models may not be very strong on its own, but when we put their results together, we get a better and more accurate answer. It's like asking a group of people for advice instead of just one person—each one might be a little wrong, but together, they usually give a better answer.\n",

        "#Types of Ensembles techniques in Machine Learning:\n",
        "1)Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Models are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. Their results are then combined—usually by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification). This helps reduce variance and prevents overfitting.\n",
        "2)Boosting: Models are trained one after another. Each new model focuses on fixing the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all models, which helps reduce bias and improve accuracy.\n",
        "3)Stacking (Stacked Generalization): Multiple different models (often of different types) are trained and their predictions are used as inputs to a final model, called a meta-model. The meta-model learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models, aiming for better performance than any individual model.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Bagging Algorithm:\n",
        "1)Bootstrap Sampling: Divides the original training data into ‘N’ subsets and randomly selects a subset with replacement in some rows from other subsets. This step ensures that the base models are trained on diverse subsets of the data and there is no class imbalance.\n",
        "2)Base Model Training: For each bootstrapped sample we train a base model independently on that subset of data. These weak models are trained in parallel to increase computational efficiency and reduce time consumption. We can use different base learners i.e. different ML models as base learners to bring variety and robustness.\n",
        "3)Prediction Aggregation: To make a prediction on testing data combine the predictions of all base models. For classification tasks it can include majority voting or weighted majority while for regression it involves averaging the predictions.\n",
        "4)Out-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Some samples are excluded from the training subset of particular base models during the bootstrapping method. These “out-of-bag” samples can be used to estimate the model’s performance without the need for cross-validation.\n",
        "5)Final Prediction: After aggregating the predictions from all the base models, Bagging produces a final prediction for each instance.\n",
        "objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Reduce Variance:\n",
        "    - Bagging aims to decrease the variance of the predictions by averaging or voting across multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.\n",
        "    - This helps in making the overall model more stable and less prone to overfitting.\n",
        "2)Improve Stability:\n",
        "    - By combining predictions from models trained on different bootstrap samples, bagging reduces the impact of outliers or noise in the data.\n",

        "2. Boosting Algorithm:\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Weak models are trained in series such that each next model tries to correct errors of the previous model until the entire training dataset is predicted correctly. One of the most well-known boosting algorithms is AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting).\n",

        "2)Train Weak Learner: Train weak learners on these dataset.\n",
        "3)Sequential Learning: Boosting works by training models sequentially where each model focuses on correcting the errors of its predecessor. Boosting typically uses a single type of weak learner like decision trees.\n",
        "4)Weight Adjustment: Boosting assigns weights to training datapoints. Misclassified examples receive higher weights in the next iteration so that next models pay more attention to them.\n",
